    <p> In order to ensure high usability across all screen sizes and resolutions, responsive web design (RWD) is a web design strategy. It is how a multi-device web should be designed. We'll explain various methods for mastering it in this article to assist you. It also doesn't work to design a non-resizable web page by specifying a fixed width; this results in scroll bars on devices with narrow displays and too much empty space on screens with broad displays. Whether content is seen on a tablet, phone, television, or watch, responsive web design, or RWD, is a design technique that handles the variety of devices and device sizes and enables automated adaptation to the screen. Responsive web design is an approach rather than a distinct technology which makes then website look good on all devices and expands the functionality of the web design. We have a ton of capabilities integrated into the web platform to help developing responsive sites easier. Modern CSS layout methods are naturally responsive. With the use of media queries, we can perform a number of tests (such as determining whether the user's screen is wider than a specific width or has a specific resolution) and apply CSS selectively to the page in order to design it for the user's needs. A responsive page will typically have the following tag in the document's HTML source, as shown below. This viewport meta element instructs mobile browsers to scale the content to 100% of its intended size and set the viewport width to the device width, displaying it at the mobile-optimized size that you intended.
